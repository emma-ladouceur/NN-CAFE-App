Analysis associated with the [Nutrient Network](https://nutnet.org/home), a global collaborative experiment consisting of replicated fertilization treatments in grassland habitats across 6 continents.

This is a shiny app to explore site-level results looking at community changes due to the addition of multiple limiting nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium- NPK) compared to experimental controls across time.
